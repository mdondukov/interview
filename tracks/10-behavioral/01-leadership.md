## "Tell me about a time you led a project"

### STAR Template

```
SITUATION:
- Компания, команда, контекст
- Почему это было важно
- Какие были challenges

TASK:
- Ваша роль (не обязательно формальный лидер)
- Цель проекта
- Constraints (время, ресурсы)

ACTION (подробно):
- Как сформировали vision
- Как выстроили план
- Как мотивировали команду
- Как справлялись с препятствиями
- Как коммуницировали прогресс

RESULT:
- Бизнес-результат (метрики)
- Impact на команду
- Что узнали
```

### Пример ответа

```
"At my previous company, I led the migration from a monolithic
architecture to microservices for our core payment system.

SITUATION: Our monolith was becoming a bottleneck - deployments
took 4 hours, one team's bug could take down the entire system,
and we couldn't scale different components independently.

TASK: I wasn't formally the tech lead, but I saw the problem and
proposed a migration plan to my manager. He gave me the green light
to lead this initiative across 3 teams (12 engineers).

ACTION:
- First, I created a technical vision document outlining the target
  architecture and shared it widely for feedback
- I identified the highest-risk service (payments) to migrate first
  as a proof of concept
- I held weekly sync meetings with all three teams to coordinate
  dependencies and address blockers
- When we hit a major obstacle (shared database), I proposed a
  strangler fig pattern and got buy-in from skeptical senior engineers
  by setting up a small POC first
- I created a dashboard tracking migration progress and shared weekly
  updates with leadership

RESULT:
- Completed migration in 6 months (original estimate was 12)
- Deployment time reduced from 4 hours to 15 minutes
- Zero production incidents during migration
- Two engineers I mentored through this were promoted
- This approach became the template for future migrations"

## "Tell me about a time you influenced without authority"

### Key Points

```
Показать:
- Как поняли stakeholders и их мотивации
- Как построили coalition
- Как использовали data/evidence
- Как справились с сопротивлением
- Результат и buy-in
```

### Пример ответа

```
"I wanted to introduce TypeScript to our frontend codebase, but
faced resistance from the senior engineer who had designed the
current JavaScript architecture.

SITUATION: Our JS codebase had grown to 200k lines, and we were
spending 30% of our debugging time on type-related issues.

TASK: Convince the team to adopt TypeScript without making the
senior engineer feel his work was being criticized.

ACTION:
- Started by understanding his concerns: learning curve, migration
  effort, build complexity
- Proposed a small experiment: convert one non-critical module
  (about 5k lines) and measure impact
- Asked him to be the code reviewer for the migration to leverage
  his expertise
- Created a migration guide addressing common patterns in our codebase
- Tracked and shared bugs caught by TypeScript during the experiment

RESULT:
After seeing 12 bugs caught during review that would have reached
production, he became a TypeScript advocate. The senior engineer
now leads our migration effort, and we've converted 60% of the
codebase with a 40% reduction in type-related bugs."

## "Tell me about a time you had to make a difficult decision"

### Framework

```
1. Какие были options
2. Какие trade-offs у каждого
3. Как собирали input
4. Как приняли решение
5. Как коммуницировали
6. Что получилось
```

### Типы сложных решений

```
- Technical: архитектура, технологии
- People: hiring, firing, team structure
- Business: prioritization, scope
- Timing: когда запускать, когда откладывать
- Resource: buy vs build
```

## "Tell me about a time you mentored someone"

### Пример ответа

```
"When I joined as a senior engineer, I was assigned to mentor a
junior developer who was struggling with code reviews.

SITUATION: She had been on the team for 6 months but her PRs were
regularly blocked for days due to quality issues. Her confidence
was low and she was considering leaving.

TASK: Help her improve her code quality and rebuild her confidence.

ACTION:
- First, I had a 1:1 to understand her perspective - she felt the
  code review feedback was vague and didn't know how to improve
- I started pair programming with her 3x/week for 30 minutes,
  talking through my thought process as we coded
- Created a 'pre-review checklist' she could use before submitting PRs
- Gave specific, actionable feedback instead of 'this could be better'
- Celebrated small wins publicly in team standups
- Connected her with a women-in-tech group for additional support

RESULT:
Within 3 months, her PR approval rate went from 30% first-try to 85%.
She's now mentoring a new junior developer herself. She told me
this experience was pivotal in her deciding to stay in engineering."

## Common Mistakes

```
❌ Mistakes to avoid:

1. Focusing only on WHAT, not HOW you led
   "We built the system and shipped it on time"
   → Missing: how did you lead, influence, decide?

2. Taking all credit / no credit
   "I did everything" ← too egotistical
   "The team did great" ← where was YOUR contribution?

3. Not showing growth
   Good answers show what you LEARNED from leading

4. Only positive examples
   Best leaders show how they handled setbacks too

5. Too tactical, not strategic
   Show you can think about the big picture
```

## Follow-up вопросы

```
Будьте готовы к:

- "What would you do differently?"
- "How did you handle disagreement within the team?"
- "What was the hardest part?"
- "How did you prioritize?"
- "What did you learn?"
- "How did you measure success?"
```
